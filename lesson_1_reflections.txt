Hola,

Aquí mis reflecciones de la leccion 1 del curso de Git y Github.

Gracias

¿How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see
the bug that was introduced?

Yes, thank you.

How could having easy acces to the entire history of a file make you
a more efficient programer in the long term?

Yes, thank you.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to
create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having version automatically
saved, like Google Docs does?

Yes, thank you.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving
multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat 
each file separately?

Yes, thank you.
